This project aims to create a basic recipe website. This will have a main index page with links to a couple recipes. Forming proper structure and familiarity with html boilerplate and page format. As well as reinforcing git work flow. Gained a better understanding on how to go about making html pages learned to save progress and appreciate the importance of using Git. Project is fairly bare bones, will come back to make it look cleaner. Overall enjoyed doing this, looking forward to future projects.
